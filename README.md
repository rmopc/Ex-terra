# Ex-terra - game demo

Made in Unity, as part of my education I demonstrated my skills in game-development. I focused on scripting and game-mechanics, but also on cameramanagement, post-processing and animation to name a few. A key feature was to implement a savegame system that saves player position and status of interacted objects to a web-database.
